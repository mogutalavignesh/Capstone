# Capstone
The strategy undertaken for the project was to enhance operational efficiencies in hospitals

by data analytics, by enabling predictions about the admission rate of patients, enhancing the

scheduling of staff, and maintaining their inventory of medical supplies. The project started

with a comprehensive analysis of historical data like patient admissions, the roster of staff, and

their inventory levels. Both ARIMA and Gradient were used for forecasting future admission

rates to enable better planning and resource allocation. Clustering algorithms segmented

patient data, enabling the determination of peak times and patterns that affect hospital

capacity. Besides, optimization techniques such as linear programming will be applied in

smoothing staff scheduling and inventory management to ensure adequate coverage without

being overstaffed or short of supplies. The same then visualized with results, using Power BI

to present actionable recommendations in real time to the hospital administrator. This

generally helped enhance the efficiency of the operational process in hospitals by improving

on the reduction of wastes and waiting times while increasing staff productivity.
